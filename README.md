# Battleships

Battleships is a game of logic, with players attempting to sink each others fleet by guessing co-ordinates.
This version uses a a board generated using Python lists and incorporates a logic engine to allow the computer to fire back at the user.

## Validation

### PEP8 validation
At the time of creation, the PEP8 online Python validation website was inoperative. To validate the code, a PEP8 validator that is built into the GitPod Workspace was used.

1. Run the command 'pip3 install pycodestyle'. (Note that this extension may already be installed, in which case this command will do nothing.)
2. In the workspace, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
3. Type the word 'linter' into the search bar that appears. 
4. Click on 'Python: Select Linter' from the filtered results.
5. Select 'pycodestyle' from the list.
6. PEP8 errors will now be underlined in red, as well as being listed in the PROBLEMS tab beside your terminal;

3. Click the "new" button in the upper right corner and select "create new app"
4. Choose an app name and your region and click "Create app"
5. Go to the "settings" tab, add the python build pack and then the node.js build pack
6. Go to the "deploy" tab and pick GitHub as a deployment method
7. Search for a repository to connect to
8. Click enable automatic deploys and then deploy branch
9. Wait for the app to build and then click on the "View" link

You can fork the repository by following these steps:
1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click on the Fork button in the upper right-hand corner

You can clone the repository by following these steps:
1. Go to the GitHub repository 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or Github CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. Type git clone and paste the URL from the clipboard ($ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY)
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.
